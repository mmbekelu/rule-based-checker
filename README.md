Rule-Based Checker (v0.1)

This program checks a structured request and decides whether it is ALLOWED or BLOCKED using clear, deterministic rules.

What It Does

Normalizes input

Lowercases user and role

Checks required fields

Ensures user, role, and actions exist

Blocks invalid values

Empty fields

Invalid roles or actions

Enforces role-based permissions

Prevents unauthorized actions

Blocks banned users immediately

Applies age-based limits

Restricts actions based on age

Returns a clear reason when blocked

No vague errors or guessing

Why I Made This

AI should not decide safety or permissions by itself.

This checker blocks unsafe or invalid requests before they reach AI or downstream logic.

It makes systems:

Safer

Predictable

Explainable

How It Works

Rules are checked in a fixed order

If any rule fails, the request is BLOCKED

The first failed rule determines the reason

If no rules fail, the request is ALLOWED

No loops.
No guessing.
Only explicit logic.

Examples
Allowed Request

Input

{
    "user": "Meshack",
    "role": "viewer",
    "actions": ["read", "comment"],
    "age": 15,
    "flags": ["new_user"]
}


Output

ALLOWED

Blocked Request

Input

{
    "user": "Alex",
    "role": "viewer",
    "actions": ["post"]
}


Output

BLOCKED — VIEWER_NO_POST_DELETE
